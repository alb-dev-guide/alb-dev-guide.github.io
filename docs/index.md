## About this guide

This doc is a working document to cover how Alb--the compiler frontend for the [Habit programming language](https://www.habit-lang.org/)--works and how to get started on contributing to the compiler.

This guide is inspired by the excellent [rustc-dev-guide](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/) for the Rust programming language.
